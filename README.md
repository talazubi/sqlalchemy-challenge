# SQLAlchemy Challenge

## Overview 
This repository contains the solution to the SQLAlchemy Challenge, in which I was responsible for analyzing climate data from Honolulu, Hawaii and designing a Flask API to exhibit the data. The first portion of the project I successfully familiarised myself with Python and SQLAlchemy, to integrate, interprete and organise the data provided. After having dessiminated the data, the second portion was to design a climate app using Flask API, to portray the data in a functional website format and have it effectively retrieve the data. 

**Part 1: Analyze and Explore the Climate Data**: In the climate_starter.ipynb file, I analyzed climate data using Python and SQLAlchemy. To access the data, I connected the SQLite database, and conducted a precipitation analysis. I queried the last 12 months of rainfall, and loaded them into a Pandas DataFrame to organise the results. To create a visualization, I utilised Matplotlib. The other set of results was about the stations, and similar to precipitation, I found the most active stations, queried the temperature data and plotted it.  

**Part 2: Design Your Climate App**: In the second portion of the project, I built a Flask API to convey the climate data, and embedded multiple routes for organization of information. This part can be referenced in the app.py file, for more details on the specifics of each route and what information it contains. The API provided me with a mechanism to convey the climate data in a JSON format. 

## Conclusion
This project effectively enhances my coding skills, as it creatively requires SQLAlchemy for database management, Pandas for data analysis, and Matplotlib for data visualization. The information collected can be further supplemented with the inclusion of a Flask API, to create a website that demonstrates and arranges the data.
